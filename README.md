# Timer

This is a timer where the user has the ability to input the minutes and seconds they want the timer to be. The timer counts down by one second once it has reached zero the timer is over. The user has the ability to start and stop the timer any time they want. Once the timer is over the user also has the ability to reset the timer which will return the time to its default time which is one minute.
